#Admin API

#The Admin API represents all functionality that a Design Huddle client administrator may perform. Most API methods do not require a specific user context and can be accessed using an App Access Token for authorization, but some methods must run on behalf of a specific user and therefore must use a User Access Token. The most common integration use cases consist of template management/synchronization and updating/approving/exporting user-created design projects. Read more about authentication <a target=\"_parent\" href=\"https://api.designhuddle.com#authentication\">here</a> and embedding the Design Huddle editor <a target=\"_parent\" href=\"https://api.designhuddle.com#embedding\">here</a>.
